package imagination_tools // import "github.com/hrom-in-space/imagination-tools"

Package imagination_tools is a small collection of helpers and thin wrappers
that make it easier to build services around Google Cloud Pub/Sub, Cloud Storage
and CloudEvents. It aims to be pragmatic and minimal: a few focused utilities
you can depend on without pulling in heavy frameworks.


==== github.com/hrom-in-space/imagination-tools/econ ====
package econ // import "github.com/hrom-in-space/imagination-tools/econ"

Package econ provides helper types and functions for working with CloudEvents
that wrap Google Cloud Pub/Sub messages. It helps decode the CloudEvent data
payload into your own Go structs.

FUNCTIONS

func EventToStruct(e event.Event, v any) error
    EventToStruct extracts the Pub/Sub message from a CloudEvent and
    unmarshals its JSON data into v. v must be a pointer to a struct or other
    JSON-decodable value.


TYPES

type MessagePublishedData struct {
	Message PubsubMessage `json:"message"`
}
    MessagePublishedData is the CloudEvent data wrapper defined by
    google.events.cloud.pubsub.v1.MessagePublishedData, containing the published
    PubsubMessage. Only the `message` field is modeled here.

type PubsubMessage struct {
	Attributes map[string]string `json:"attributes"`
	Data       []byte            `json:"data"`
}
    PubsubMessage represents the inner Pub/Sub message payload as defined
    by google.events.cloud.pubsub.v1.PubsubMessage (fields included here
    are limited to what we currently need for decoding business payloads).
    When unmarshaled from JSON, Data is automatically base64-decoded.



==== github.com/hrom-in-space/imagination-tools/schemas ====
package schemas // import "github.com/hrom-in-space/imagination-tools/schemas"

Package schemas contains Go types generated from Avro schemas.

The types are plain data containers you can serialize to JSON or use with
Pub/Sub and CloudEvents. They are generated by the `avrogo` tool from the .avsc
files in this directory.

TYPES

type StoryDraftedV1 struct {
	TaskID        string `json:"taskID"`
	ArtifactCount int    `json:"artifactCount"`
}

func (StoryDraftedV1) AvroRecord() avrotypegen.RecordInfo
    AvroRecord implements the avro.AvroRecord interface.

type StoryUploadedV1 struct {
	TaskID string `json:"taskID"`
}

func (StoryUploadedV1) AvroRecord() avrotypegen.RecordInfo
    AvroRecord implements the avro.AvroRecord interface.



==== github.com/hrom-in-space/imagination-tools/simpler ====
package simpler // import "github.com/hrom-in-space/imagination-tools/simpler"

Package simpler provides small, pragmatic helpers for Google Cloud Pub/Sub and
Google Cloud Storage.

Package simpler provides a high-level interface for interacting with Google
Cloud Pub/Sub.

Cloud Storage.

TYPES

type PubSubClient interface {
	// PublishMessage publishes a message.
	PublishMessage(ctx context.Context, topicID string, object any) error
}
    PubSubClient handles Google Cloud Pub/Sub operations.

func NewPubSubClient(ctx context.Context, projectID string) (PubSubClient, error)
    NewPubSubClient creates a new Pub/Sub client that implements PubSubClient.

type StorageClient interface {
	// UploadFile uploads a file to the specified bucket.
	UploadFile(ctx context.Context, bucket string, name string, content io.Reader) error
}

func NewStorageClient(ctx context.Context) (StorageClient, error)
    NewStorageClient creates a new StorageGateway instance.
